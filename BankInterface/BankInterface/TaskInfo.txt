The next task will be a fresh project and involved interfaces and bank accounts. 
IE the IBankAccount, with a look to actually use an interface as the base for the list for many different types, but the functions themselves are different.
 
So im looking for IBankAccount
 
this should have the common stuff an account does: 
 
AddMoney
WithdrawMoney
GetBalance
 
But the accounts that implement the interface would be 
 
Current
Savings
Mortgage
 
Each of the functions/mehods will do something slightly different on each one
 
Current account:
 
add money - adds to balance
withdraw money - just takes money
get balance - shows balance
 
Savings account:

add money - also adds interest
Withdraw money - removes interest if account age is younger than 12 months
get balance - shows balance but also the interest bonus of the balance as a percentage
 
Mortgage:
 - Add money takes from remaning balance and adds to amount paid
 Withdraw money - shows a message saying it is not that type of account
get balance shows outstanding and paid balances
 
 
to display this info we should be looping through an array of IBankAccount 
 
Bonus info for  next stage: We will be making a menu to access this information, the bank accounts will potentially need an identifier to search on, what could be included that is unique?
